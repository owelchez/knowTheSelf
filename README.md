Petal # 7

My Goal, Purpose, or Mission in Life (or my philosophy about life):

I want to finish the bootcamp program, I believe that this will be my main entrance into programming using lower level languages later and eventually become a software or video game programmer. I want my six year old son to see that studying is important and also the only way to achieve anything in life.
My philosophy would be that anybody can be happy, but we need to make sure that we are not making anyone else’s life miserable in the process. We have to find ways of healing the planet since we haven’t been doing a good job when it comes to pollution and deforestation, chemical waste…Why are we even creating chemicals? I want to plant trees, I recycle paper waste in the office, I reuse plastic bags and every other little thing that I can to help with the environment.
